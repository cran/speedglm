version 0.2
===============
* the data1 dataset has been added to the package. This permits to run the second example in the help page of speedglm without using a connection to the URL "http://dssm.unipa.it/enea/data1.txt" which could fail.
* argument data from shglm() changed to datafun.
* a bug has been fixed using  print.summary.speedlm(). Now the rounding of the t statistic in the output print works correctly.
* the author's email address has changed
