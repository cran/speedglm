Fitting Linear and Generalized Linear Models to Large Data Sets
}
\description{
Fits Linear and Generalized Linear Models to large data sets. For data loaded in R memory the fitting is usually
fast, especially if R is linked against an optimized BLAS. For data sets of size greater 
of R memory, the fitting is made by an updating algorithm.}
